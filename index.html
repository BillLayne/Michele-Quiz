                question: "A homeowner leaves oily rags piled up in their garage, making it easier for a fire to start. What type of problem is this?",
                answers: [
                    "Physical Hazard",
                    "Moral Hazard",
                    "Morale Hazard",

                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Think of a Physical Hazard as something you can see or touch that makes an accident more likely. Oily rags are a real, physical thing that can catch fire. It's like leaving your bike unlocked - that's a physical condition that makes theft more likely. A Moral Hazard would be if someone intentionally tried to cause damage (like planning to burn down their house for insurance money). A Morale Hazard is when someone is careless because they have insurance (like not caring if your car gets dinged because insurance will fix it).",
                simpleAnswer: "Physical Hazard - It's a real, physical thing you can see that makes an accident more likely to happen."

                question: "After paying a customer's claim, the insurance company wants to go after the person who actually caused the damage to get their money back. What is this called?",
                answers: [
                    "Indemnity",
                    "Contribution",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Subrogation is when the insurance company 'steps into your shoes' after paying your claim. Imagine: Someone hits your parked car and drives away. Your insurance pays to fix it. Now YOUR insurance company has the right to chase down that hit-and-run driver and sue them to get the money back. They're basically taking over your right to sue that person. Think of it like when your parent pays for something you broke, then they have the right to punish you or make you pay them back. Indemnity just means getting you back to where you were before the loss. Contribution is when two insurance policies share the cost.",
                simpleAnswer: "Subrogation - The insurance company takes your place and goes after whoever caused the damage to get their money back."

                question: "Which one of these is something you could either win or lose money on? (Not something insurance covers)",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Insurance only covers 'Pure Risks' - situations where you can only lose money or stay the same, never win money. Think of it this way: If your house burns down, you can't somehow make money from it - you only lose. But the stock market is different - you might lose money OR you might make money! That's called a Speculative Risk. It's like gambling - you could win big or lose big. Insurance never covers gambling or investments because you chose to take that risk hoping to make money. Insurance is only for protecting you from bad things that might happen, not for things where you're trying to make a profit.",
                simpleAnswer: "Stock market - It's the only one where you could either make money or lose money. Insurance only covers things where you can only lose."

                question: "Why can insurance companies predict how many claims they'll get? What rule helps them?",
                answers: [

                    "Law of Large Numbers",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Law of Large Numbers is like flipping a coin. If you flip it 10 times, you might get 7 heads and 3 tails - kind of random. But if you flip it 10,000 times, you'll get almost exactly 5,000 heads and 5,000 tails. The more you do it, the more predictable it gets! Insurance works the same way. With just 10 houses, the company can't predict much. But with 100,000 houses, they can predict very accurately how many will have fires, thefts, or storm damage each year. It's like having a huge sample size - patterns become clear and predictable. That's how they know what to charge for insurance!",
                simpleAnswer: "Law of Large Numbers - The more houses (or cars, etc.) an insurance company covers, the easier it is to predict how many claims will happen."

                question: "What part of an insurance policy contains the company's main promise to pay you if something bad happens?",

                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Think of an insurance policy like a contract with different sections. The Insuring Agreement is the most important part - it's where the insurance company promises 'We will pay for these specific things if they happen to you.' It's like when you shake hands on a deal. The Declarations page is just the info page (your name, address, how much you're paying). The Conditions are the rules you both have to follow. The Exclusions are the 'we will NOT pay for these things' list. But the Insuring Agreement is the heart of it all - it's THE promise that makes the whole policy worth having.",
                simpleAnswer: "Insuring Agreement - This is where the insurance company makes their main promise to pay you for covered losses."

                question: "Someone lies on their insurance application, saying they have a burglar alarm when they really don't. What is this lie called?",
                answers: [

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "A Misrepresentation is simply a fancy word for telling a lie or giving wrong information. If it's important information (like lying about having an alarm), it's a 'Material Misrepresentation' and the insurance company can cancel your policy. Think of applying for insurance like applying for a job - you have to tell the truth. If you lie on a job application and say you have experience you don't have, the employer can fire you when they find out. Same thing here! A Warranty would be a promise that something is 100% true (even stronger than a representation). A Waiver is giving up a right you have.",
                simpleAnswer: "Misrepresentation - This means lying or giving wrong information on your application."

            {
                question: "The insurance company writes the entire policy, and you can either accept it as-is or not buy it. What kind of contract is this?",
                answers: [
                    "Unilateral Contract",

                ],
                correct: 3,
                explanation: "A Contract of Adhesion is like a 'take it or leave it' deal. The insurance company writes everything, and you can't negotiate or change the words. It's like the terms and conditions on your phone - Apple or Samsung wrote them, you just click 'agree.' You have no power to change them. Because of this, if something in the policy is confusing or unclear, the courts will side with YOU (the customer), not the big insurance company. It's only fair, since you didn't get to help write it! A Unilateral Contract means only one party makes promises. An Aleatory Contract means the money exchanged isn't equal.",

                question: "You pay $1,200 per year for insurance, and the insurance company's promise to pay claims is based on what you paid and what you said in your application. What is this payment and these statements called?",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "In legal terms, Consideration is what each side gives up to make a contract valid. Think of it like a trade. When you buy a candy bar, your consideration is the dollar you pay, and the store's consideration is the candy they give you. In insurance, YOUR consideration is two things: (1) the money you pay (premiums) and (2) the truthful statements you made on your application. The INSURANCE COMPANY'S consideration is their promise to pay if something bad happens. Both sides have to give something for the contract to be real and legal. Without consideration, you just have empty promises!",
                simpleAnswer: "Consideration - This is what you give (your money and truthful information) and what they give (promise to pay claims) to make the deal valid."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "The Commissioner of Insurance is like the referee for the insurance industry in North Carolina. This person makes sure insurance companies play by the rules, treats customers fairly, and has enough money to pay claims. The Commissioner is elected by the citizens of NC (you get to vote for them!), serves for 4 years, and has the power to license agents, investigate complaints, and punish companies that break the law. Think of them as the 'insurance police chief' for the whole state. They work for the people, not for the insurance companies. They also serve as the State Fire Marshall.",

                question: "An insurance agent offers to give someone $50 cash back if they buy a policy from them instead of another agent. Is this allowed?",
                answers: [
                    "Yes, it's good marketing",
                    "Yes, but only with supervisor approval",

                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Rebating is strictly illegal in North Carolina and most states. Here's why: If agents could offer cash or gifts to get people to buy insurance, it would become a bidding war. Agents would compete by offering bigger bribes instead of better service or coverage. Poor people who can't afford these kickbacks would get worse deals. It would also mean people might choose insurance based on getting money back rather than getting the RIGHT insurance for their needs. Think of it like a doctor paying you to choose them instead of another doctor - that's just wrong! Insurance agents must compete based on service and knowledge, not bribes.",
                simpleAnswer: "No - Rebating (offering cash or special deals not listed in the policy) is illegal because it's like bribing someone to buy insurance."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Here's the key difference: Homeowners policies (HO-3, HO-5, etc.) are for houses where the OWNER lives. But if you own a house and rent it out to someone else, you need a Dwelling Policy instead. Think of it this way: Homeowners policies assume you'll take good care of the place because you live there. But rental properties have more risks - tenants might not care for the property as well, it might sit empty between renters, etc. Dwelling Policies are designed for these situations. The HO-4 is for renters (they don't own the building). The HO-6 is for condo owners. A DP-3 is perfect for a rental property you own.",
                simpleAnswer: "Dwelling Policy (DP-3) - Use this for rental properties you own but don't live in. Homeowners policies are only for homes you live in."

                explanation: "The DP-3 has different levels of protection for different things. Think of it like a video game with different armor levels! The BUILDING gets the best protection - it's covered for almost everything except specific exclusions (this is called 'open peril' or 'special form'). But your PERSONAL PROPERTY (your stuff inside) only gets 'named peril' coverage - it's only protected against specific types of damage that are listed in the policy, like fire, lightning, windstorm, theft, vandalism, etc. It's not covered for everything. So the building has better coverage than your stuff inside it. If you want better coverage for your belongings, you'd need an HO-5 policy.",

                explanation: "Think of the dwelling policies as three levels: Basic (DP-1), Better (DP-2), and Best (DP-3). The DP-1 is super basic - it covers fire, lightning, and internal explosion. You can add 'Extended Coverage' to get windstorm, hail, smoke, riot, etc., and you can add 'Vandalism and Malicious Mischief.' But even with all those additions, a DP-1 still doesn't cover some things. The DP-2 automatically includes all the DP-1 stuff PLUS extra 'broad form perils' like: falling objects, weight of ice and snow on the roof, frozen pipes bursting, etc. So 'weight of ice and snow' is a DP-2 special feature! Fire, windstorm, and vandalism can all be added to a DP-1.",

Coverage B covers structures that are DETACHED (separate) from the main house - like a tool shed, detached garage, fence, or swimming pool. Your shed is detached, so it goes under Coverage B. Usually, Coverage B is automatically set at 10% of your Coverage A limit (so if the house is insured for $200,000, the shed coverage is $20,000). Coverage C would be for stuff INSIDE the buildings (furniture, tools, etc.). Coverage D is for lost rent if the place becomes unlivable.",

The big difference is in how they cover your STUFF (personal property). Think of it like phone insurance: The HO-3 is like basic coverage - your building is well protected, but your belongings inside are only covered for specific named problems (fire, theft, windstorm, etc.). The HO-5 is like premium coverage - BOTH the building AND your stuff inside are covered for almost everything. So if your laptop randomly breaks in an HO-5, you're probably covered.

Because floods affect huge areas all at once - if a river floods, it damages hundreds or thousands of homes at the same time. Private insurance companies can't handle that much risk. So the federal government created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to provide flood insurance. If you live in a flood zone and have a mortgage from a regular bank, you're REQUIRED to buy flood insurance.

Think of it as a risk-sharing pool. When a company has to insure a high-risk driver, they can 'cede' (transfer) that risk to the Facility.

Examples: 'Buy this policy and I'll give you $100 cash,' or 'I'll give you a free TV,' or 'I'll pay your first month's premium for you.' This is ILLEGAL because it creates unfair competition and can lead to people buying insurance for the wrong reasons (to get the kickback instead of to get the right coverage).

But if you flip it 10,000 times, you'll get very close to 5,000 heads and 5,000 tails - it becomes very predictable. Insurance is the same way. If an insurance company only insures 20 houses, they can't predict how many fires they'll have - it could be 0, could be 5.

CONDITIONALLY RENEWABLE: The company can choose not to renew based on certain conditions in the policy. NON-CANCELABLE: The company can't cancel AND can't increase your rates - you're locked in at the same price. This is rare and expensive. OPTIONALLY RENEWABLE: The company can choose to renew or not for any reason at renewal time. Most property and auto policies are Guaranteed Renewable, which protects consumers from being dropped without cause but allows the company to adjust rates based on claims experience.",

                explanation: "ALL insurance policies exclude intentional acts by the insured. This is absolutely fundamental - you cannot profit from your own intentional harmful actions. Burning down your own house for insurance money is called 'arson for profit' and is: (1) Insurance fraud (a crime), (2) Specifically excluded from coverage, and (3) Grounds for immediate policy cancellation. The insurance company will investigate, deny the claim, possibly sue to recover any payments made, and report you to law enforcement for prosecution. This is also an example of Moral Hazard (when someone's bad character leads them to create risk). Fun fact: If someone ELSE intentionally burns down your house (an arsonist), that IS covered because YOU didn't do it. The key is whether the insured person committed the intentional act.",

Your son was a 'permissive user' (you allowed him to drive), so YOUR insurance pays first. This is true even if your son caused the accident and even if he has his own car and insurance elsewhere. The liability coverage on YOUR policy (Part A) would pay for the damage to the parked car. If the damages exceeded your policy limits, then his insurance might be secondary.

                explanation: "This is SUPER important to understand! Actual Cash Value (ACV) = What it costs to replace minus depreciation (wear and tear). Replacement Cost (RC) = What it costs to replace with new. Example: Your 5-year-old TV breaks. A new one costs $800 (that's the Replacement Cost). But yours was used for 5 years, so it's depreciated 50%. ACV = $800 - $400 = $400. With ACV coverage, you get $400. With RC coverage, you get $800 to buy a new TV. Most policies pay ACV for personal property unless you specifically pay extra for RC coverage. Buildings usually get RC if insured to at least 80% of value. ACV is cheaper but leaves you short of money to replace things. RC costs more but fully replaces items.",

This covers things like: detached garages, tool sheds, fences, swimming pools, and other structures not attached to the main house. If you have an expensive detached garage or multiple structures, you might need to increase this percentage. For example, if you have a $50,000 detached garage, the standard 10% ($30,000) won't be enough - you'd need to buy additional Coverage B.

Here's why: Insurance is based on trust. The insurance company can't inspect everything about your life, so they trust you to tell the truth on your application. If you lie about having a burglar alarm, or hide that you had 3 accidents last year, you're breaking this principle. But it goes both ways! The insurance company also must be honest about what they'll cover, pay claims fairly, and not try to trick you with confusing language.

If you had a regular HO-3 policy at $400,000, you'd be paying huge premiums for a house only worth $150,000. The HO-8 solves this by paying to repair damage with similar (but not identical) materials, or paying Actual Cash Value, whichever is less. It uses basic named-peril coverage.

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "North Carolina law requires insurance companies to acknowledge receipt of a claim within 10 calendar days. This is a consumer protection to make sure your claim isn't ignored. The acknowledgment might be a phone call, letter, or email saying 'We received your claim and assigned it to adjuster John Smith.' This doesn't mean they'll PAY the claim in 10 days - just that they must confirm they got it. After acknowledgment, they must begin investigating promptly and must communicate regularly about the claim's status. If an insurance company repeatedly fails to acknowledge claims within 10 days, they can be fined by the Department of Insurance and the Commissioner might take action against them. This is part of the 'Unfair Claim Settlement Practices' regulations that protect consumers.",
                simpleAnswer: "10 days - The insurance company must let you know they received your claim within 10 calendar days (not business days, but every day including weekends)."

                explanation: "Insurable Interest prevents gambling with insurance and insurance fraud. You can only insure something if you would suffer a REAL financial loss if it were damaged or destroyed. Example: You can insure YOUR house because if it burns down, you lose money. But you can't insure your neighbor's house because you have no financial stake in it - if it burns down, you don't lose money. Why does this rule exist? Without it, people could insure random properties hoping they'd be destroyed so they could collect money. That's gambling, not insurance! For property insurance, you must have insurable interest at the TIME OF THE LOSS. For life insurance, you need it when you BUY the policy. Who has insurable interest in a house? The owner, the mortgage company, someone who would inherit it.",
                simpleAnswer: "No gambling allowed - You can only insure things where you'd actually lose money if they were damaged or destroyed (prevents betting on other people's property)."

Here's how it works: A storm damages the condo building's roof (a common area). The association's insurance has a $50,000 deductible. The association divides this $50,000 deductible among all 100 unit owners - you each owe $500. Or worse: the association is sued and their insurance isn't enough - they assess each owner $5,000 to cover the shortfall. Loss Assessment coverage pays YOUR share of these special assessments (usually up to $1,000-$50,000 depending on your policy). Without it, you'd have to pay out of pocket.

                explanation: "A property is 'vacant' when it's completely empty - no people AND no furniture/belongings. Insurance companies HATE vacancy because empty properties are much higher risk! Why? (1) No one is there to notice problems like burst pipes or fires, (2) Vandals target empty buildings, (3) Thieves know no one is watching, (4) Squatters might move in. Most policies limit coverage or exclude certain perils if a property is vacant for more than 30-60 consecutive days. You must notify your insurance company. They might charge extra or issue a special vacancy policy. 'Vacancy' is different from 'Unoccupied' - unoccupied means no people but furniture is still there (like a vacation home).

You get estimates showing $80,000 to repair. The insurance company says it should only cost $50,000. You're stuck arguing. The Appraisal Clause says: Each side picks their own appraiser (an independent expert). Those two appraisers pick a neutral umpire. Each appraiser inspects and writes a report. If they agree, that's the amount. If they disagree, the umpire breaks the tie. This decision is BINDING on both parties. It's faster and cheaper than going to court.

Normally, you'd have to wait until your policy renews to get the better coverage. But the Liberalization Clause says: If we file broader coverage at the same premium, you AUTOMATICALLY get the improvement right away, even though you're in the middle of your policy term.

AGREED VALUE: You and the insurance company agree upfront on a specific value (like $500,000) and that's what they'll pay regardless of actual rebuilding costs. This is used for things that are hard to value, like antique cars, artwork, or unique historic buildings. Why use Agreed Value? It avoids disputes about value after a loss. You both already agreed.

                explanation: "A Reservation of Rights letter is sent when the insurance company isn't sure if a claim is covered but wants to start working on it anyway. Example: Someone sues you. Your insurance company isn't sure if this is covered under your policy - it might be excluded. But the lawsuit is moving forward and you need a lawyer NOW. The insurance company sends a Reservation of Rights letter that says: 'We're going to provide you with a lawyer and investigate this claim, BUT we're reserving our right to deny coverage later if we determine it's not covered. Don't assume you're covered just because we're helping right now.' Why do this? It protects you (you get immediate help) and protects them (they're not admitting the claim is covered). If they later determine it's not covered, they can deny the claim and you're on your own.",
                simpleAnswer: "Insurance investigates but might deny later - The company will defend you NOW but reserves the right to say it's not covered after investigating further."

                explanation: "Duties After Loss is a critical section that tells you what YOU must do after a claim or your coverage can be denied. Common duties include: (1) Give immediate notice - call your insurance company right away, don't wait weeks, (2) Protect the property from further damage - if your roof is damaged, tarp it so rain doesn't cause more damage, (3) Prepare an inventory - make a list of damaged/stolen items, (4) Cooperate with investigation - answer questions, give statements, provide documents, (5) Submit proof of loss - a formal sworn statement of what was damaged and the value, (6) Allow inspection - let adjusters inspect the damage, (7) Don't make permanent repairs without permission (emergency repairs are OK). If you fail these duties, the insurance company can deny your claim! Keep records of everything you do after a loss.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Loss of Use (also called Additional Living Expense or ALE) pays for the extra costs of living somewhere else when your home is damaged and unlivable. Example: A fire damages your house and you must live in a hotel for 3 months during repairs. The insurance pays: (1) Hotel costs (minus what you'd normally pay for housing - your mortgage/rent still gets paid), (2) Extra food costs (if you have to eat out more because you can't cook), (3) Storage unit for your belongings, (4) Laundromat if you don't have a washer/dryer, (5) Lost rent if you rent out part of your home. What it does NOT pay: Your normal living expenses that you'd have anyway (your regular grocery budget, utilities for the damaged house, etc.). It only pays the EXTRA expenses of being displaced.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Estoppel prevents someone from going back on their word if someone else relied on it to their detriment. Example: Your premium is due on the 1st. For years, your insurance company has accepted late payments on the 10th without complaint. They've established a pattern. Now suddenly they cancel your policy when payment arrives on the 8th, saying it's late. You argue 'Estoppel!' - they led you to believe payment by the 10th was acceptable, and you relied on that pattern. They're 'estopped' (prevented) from suddenly enforcing the strict deadline. Another example: An agent tells you something is covered (a waiver), you rely on that and don't buy other insurance. Later the company tries to deny the claim. They may be estopped from denying because their agent's statement caused you to rely on that coverage. Estoppel protects people from surprise rule changes.",
                simpleAnswer: "Can't take back what you led someone to believe - If an insurance company or agent led you to believe something and you relied on it, they can't suddenly change their mind."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "An Endorsement (also called a 'Rider' or 'Floater') is a document that modifies your insurance policy - it adds coverage, removes coverage, or changes terms. Think of your policy as a base document, and endorsements as customization options. Examples of common endorsements: (1) Scheduled Personal Property - adds special coverage for expensive jewelry, (2) Earthquake Coverage - adds earthquake as a covered peril, (3) Water Backup Coverage - adds sewer/drain backup coverage, (4) Increased Limits - raises the coverage amounts, (5) Named Driver Exclusion - excludes a specific person from coverage. When an endorsement conflicts with the main policy, the endorsement wins (it's more recent and specific). Endorsements usually cost extra if they ADD coverage, or give you a discount if they REMOVE coverage. They become part of the official policy.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "A Loss and a Claim are related but different: LOSS = The actual event that caused damage. A fire burns your house, a thief steals your TV, a storm damages your roof - these are losses. CLAIM = Your formal request to the insurance company to pay for the loss. Example: Lightning strikes your house Friday night (the LOSS). Monday morning you call your insurance company and submit paperwork asking them to pay for repairs (the CLAIM). Not all losses result in claims - if the damage is less than your deductible, you might not file a claim. Also, just because you file a claim doesn't mean it will be paid - the insurance company might deny it if it's not covered. So: Loss = what happened, Claim = your request for payment for what happened.",

                explanation: "'Per Occurrence' means the limit applies to each separate accident or event, regardless of how many people are injured. Example: You have $300,000 'Per Occurrence' liability coverage. Scenario 1: You cause an accident that injures 5 people. Person A has $50,000 in injuries, Person B has $80,000, Person C has $100,000, Person D has $40,000, Person E has $60,000. Total = $330,000 in injuries. Your insurance pays up to $300,000 (the per occurrence limit). You're personally responsible for the remaining $30,000. All 5 people share the $300,000. Scenario 2: You cause TWO separate accidents in the same year. Accident 1 causes $300,000 in damage. Accident 2 causes $250,000 in damage. Your insurance covers BOTH fully because each occurrence has its own $300,000 limit. 'Per Occurrence' is different from 'Aggregate' which is your total limit for the whole policy period.",

                explanation: "A Peril is simply the CAUSE of a loss - the specific event or thing that damaged your property. Think of 'peril' as just another word for 'type of damage' or 'cause of damage.' Common perils include: fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, theft, vandalism, falling objects, weight of ice and snow, water damage, smoke. Insurance policies either list specific covered perils ('Named Peril' coverage) or cover all perils except excluded ones ('Open Peril' or 'All Risk' coverage). Example: Your house is damaged. HOW was it damaged? By FIRE - that's the peril. By WIND - that's the peril. By EARTHQUAKE - that's the peril. The peril determines whether you're covered.
