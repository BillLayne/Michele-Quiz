                question: "A homeowner leaves oily rags piled up in their garage, making it easier for a fire to start. What type of problem is this?",
                answers: [
                    "Physical Hazard",
                    "Moral Hazard",
                    "Morale Hazard",
                    "Legal Hazard"
                ],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Think of a Physical Hazard as something you can see or touch that makes an accident more likely. Oily rags are a real, physical thing that can catch fire. It's like leaving your bike unlocked - that's a physical condition that makes theft more likely. A Moral Hazard would be if someone intentionally tried to cause damage (like planning to burn down their house for insurance money). A Morale Hazard is when someone is careless because they have insurance (like not caring if your car gets dinged because insurance will fix it).",
                simpleAnswer: "Physical Hazard - It's a real, physical thing you can see that makes an accident more likely to happen."

            {
                question: "After paying a customer's claim, the insurance company wants to go after the person who actually caused the damage to get their money back. What is this called?",
                answers: [
                    "Indemnity",
                    "Contribution",
                    "Subrogation",
                    "Insurable Interest"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Subrogation is when the insurance company 'steps into your shoes' after paying your claim. Imagine: Someone hits your parked car and drives away. Your insurance pays to fix it. Now YOUR insurance company has the right to chase down that hit-and-run driver and sue them to get the money back. They're basically taking over your right to sue that person. Think of it like when your parent pays for something you broke, then they have the right to punish you or make you pay them back. Indemnity just means getting you back to where you were before the loss. Contribution is when two insurance policies share the cost.",
                simpleAnswer: "Subrogation - The insurance company takes your place and goes after whoever caused the damage to get their money back."
            },
            {
                question: "Which one of these is something you could either win or lose money on? (Not something insurance covers)",
                answers: [
                    "Your home being damaged by a hurricane",
                    "Your car being stolen",
                    "Losing money in the stock market",
                    "Getting sick and needing a doctor"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Insurance only covers 'Pure Risks' - situations where you can only lose money or stay the same, never win money. Think of it this way: If your house burns down, you can't somehow make money from it - you only lose. But the stock market is different - you might lose money OR you might make money! That's called a Speculative Risk. It's like gambling - you could win big or lose big. Insurance never covers gambling or investments because you chose to take that risk hoping to make money. Insurance is only for protecting you from bad things that might happen, not for things where you're trying to make a profit.",
                simpleAnswer: "Stock market - It's the only one where you could either make money or lose money. Insurance only covers things where you can only lose."
            },
            {
                question: "Why can insurance companies predict how many claims they'll get? What rule helps them?",
                answers: [
                    "Principle of Indemnity",
                    "Law of Large Numbers",
                    "Doctrine of Proximate Cause",
                    "Concept of Adverse Selection"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Law of Large Numbers is like flipping a coin. If you flip it 10 times, you might get 7 heads and 3 tails - kind of random. But if you flip it 10,000 times, you'll get almost exactly 5,000 heads and 5,000 tails. The more you do it, the more predictable it gets! Insurance works the same way. With just 10 houses, the company can't predict much. But with 100,000 houses, they can predict very accurately how many will have fires, thefts, or storm damage each year. It's like having a huge sample size - patterns become clear and predictable. That's how they know what to charge for insurance!",
                simpleAnswer: "Law of Large Numbers - The more houses (or cars, etc.) an insurance company covers, the easier it is to predict how many claims will happen."
            },
            {
                question: "What part of an insurance policy contains the company's main promise to pay you if something bad happens?",
                answers: [
                    "Declarations",
                    "Insuring Agreement",

                    "Exclusions"
                ],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Think of an insurance policy like a contract with different sections. The Insuring Agreement is the most important part - it's where the insurance company promises 'We will pay for these specific things if they happen to you.' It's like when you shake hands on a deal. The Declarations page is just the info page (your name, address, how much you're paying). The Conditions are the rules you both have to follow. The Exclusions are the 'we will NOT pay for these things' list. But the Insuring Agreement is the heart of it all - it's THE promise that makes the whole policy worth having.",
                simpleAnswer: "Insuring Agreement - This is where the insurance company makes their main promise to pay you for covered losses."
            },
            {
                question: "Someone lies on their insurance application, saying they have a burglar alarm when they really don't. What is this lie called?",
                answers: [
                    "Warranty",
                    "Waiver",

                    "Condition"
                ],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "A Misrepresentation is simply a fancy word for telling a lie or giving wrong information. If it's important information (like lying about having an alarm), it's a 'Material Misrepresentation' and the insurance company can cancel your policy. Think of applying for insurance like applying for a job - you have to tell the truth. If you lie on a job application and say you have experience you don't have, the employer can fire you when they find out. Same thing here! A Warranty would be a promise that something is 100% true (even stronger than a representation). A Waiver is giving up a right you have.",
                simpleAnswer: "Misrepresentation - This means lying or giving wrong information on your application."
            },
            {
                question: "The insurance company writes the entire policy, and you can either accept it as-is or not buy it. What kind of contract is this?",
                answers: [
                    "Unilateral Contract",
                    "Aleatory Contract",
                    "Conditional Contract",
                    "Contract of Adhesion"
                ],
                correct: 3,
                explanation: "A Contract of Adhesion is like a 'take it or leave it' deal. The insurance company writes everything, and you can't negotiate or change the words. It's like the terms and conditions on your phone - Apple or Samsung wrote them, you just click 'agree.' You have no power to change them. Because of this, if something in the policy is confusing or unclear, the courts will side with YOU (the customer), not the big insurance company. It's only fair, since you didn't get to help write it! A Unilateral Contract means only one party makes promises. An Aleatory Contract means the money exchanged isn't equal.",
                simpleAnswer: "Contract of Adhesion - A 'take it or leave it' deal where the insurance company wrote everything and you can't change any words."
            },

                question: "You pay $1,200 per year for insurance, and the insurance company's promise to pay claims is based on what you paid and what you said in your application. What is this payment and these statements called?",
                answers: [
                    "Offer",

When you buy a candy bar, your consideration is the dollar you pay, and the store's consideration is the candy they give you. In insurance, YOUR consideration is two things: (1) the money you pay (premiums) and (2) the truthful statements you made on your application. The INSURANCE COMPANY'S consideration is their promise to pay if something bad happens. Both sides have to give something for the contract to be real and legal. Without consideration, you just have empty promises!",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Rebating is strictly illegal in North Carolina and most states. Here's why: If agents could offer cash or gifts to get people to buy insurance, it would become a bidding war. Agents would compete by offering bigger bribes instead of better service or coverage. Poor people who can't afford these kickbacks would get worse deals. It would also mean people might choose insurance based on getting money back rather than getting the RIGHT insurance for their needs. Think of it like a doctor paying you to choose them instead of another doctor - that's just wrong! Insurance agents must compete based on service and knowledge, not bribes.",

But if you own a house and rent it out to someone else, you need a Dwelling Policy instead. Think of it this way: Homeowners policies assume you'll take good care of the place because you live there. But rental properties have more risks - tenants might not care for the property as well, it might sit empty between renters, etc. Dwelling Policies are designed for these situations.

The DP-1 is super basic - it covers fire, lightning, and internal explosion. You can add 'Extended Coverage' to get windstorm, hail, smoke, riot, etc., and you can add 'Vandalism and Malicious Mischief.' But even with all those additions, a DP-1 still doesn't cover some things. The DP-2 automatically includes all the DP-1 stuff PLUS extra 'broad form perils' like: falling objects, weight of ice and snow on the roof, frozen pipes bursting, etc. So 'weight of ice and snow' is a DP-2 special feature!

Because floods affect huge areas all at once - if a river floods, it damages hundreds or thousands of homes at the same time. Private insurance companies can't handle that much risk. So the federal government created the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) to provide flood insurance. If you live in a flood zone and have a mortgage from a regular bank, you're REQUIRED to buy flood insurance.

If an employee gets hurt on the job, Workers' Comp automatically pays their medical bills and replaces some of their lost wages - they don't have to sue the employer or prove the employer did anything wrong. In exchange, employees give up the right to sue their employer. It's like a truce: employees get guaranteed benefits quickly, and employers have protection from lawsuits. Note: You can voluntarily get it with fewer than 3 employees, but you're not required to until you hit 3.",

The logic is: if you have a $200,000 house, you probably have around $100,000 worth of stuff inside - furniture, appliances, clothes, electronics, etc. Of course, this is just a starting point. If you have a LOT of expensive stuff (art collection, jewelry, etc.), you can increase Coverage C. Or if you don't have much stuff, you might decrease it to save money.

If your home becomes unlivable due to a covered loss (like a fire), Coverage D pays for: (1) Additional Living Expenses (ALE) - the EXTRA costs of living somewhere else (hotel, eating out more, etc.), and (2) Fair Rental Value - lost rent if you rent part of your home to others. Example: Your house is insured for $200,000 (Coverage A). A fire makes it unlivable for 4 months. Coverage D is $60,000 (30% of $200,000). You rent an apartment for $2,000/month ($8,000 total) and your normal mortgage is $1,500/month.

The ACV is $8,000 - $3,200 (40%) = $4,800. That's what you'd get. Why? Because the furniture is used, and the insurance wants to put you back to where you were BEFORE the loss, not make you better off (that's the principle of indemnity).

Now your insurance company has the right (through subrogation) to sue the person who started the fire to recover that $50,000. They've taken over YOUR right to sue. Why does this matter?

Replacement Cost (RC) = What it costs to replace with new. Example: Your 5-year-old TV breaks. A new one costs $800 (that's the Replacement Cost). But yours was used for 5 years, so it's depreciated 50%. ACV = $800 - $400 = $400. With ACV coverage, you get $400. With RC coverage, you get $800 to buy a new TV.

                explanation: "You must be at least 18 years old to get an insurance producer license in North Carolina. This is the legal age of majority (adulthood) in NC. Why this age? Because selling insurance involves entering into legal contracts, and you must be legally competent to do so. The requirements for an NC P&C license include: (1) Be at least 18 years old, (2) Complete required pre-licensing education courses (20 hours each for Property and Casualty), (3) Pass the licensing exam(s), (4) Submit fingerprints for a background check, (5) Have no disqualifying criminal convictions, and (6) Apply through NIPR. There's no maximum age limit - you can get licensed at any age over 18!",
                simpleAnswer: "18 years old - You must be a legal adult to sell insurance and sign contracts in North Carolina."

Part C protects YOU from uninsured drivers. Parts B (Medical Payments) and D (Collision/Comprehensive for your own car) are OPTIONAL. You can drive legally with just A and C. Why are these two required? Liability protects society - if you hurt someone, they need to be compensated. Uninsured Motorist protects you because NC has many uninsured drivers on the road.

                explanation: "The 80% rule (also called the coinsurance clause) penalizes you for under-insuring your property. Here's how it works: Your house would cost $200,000 to rebuild (replacement cost). You should insure it for at least $160,000 (80% of $200,000). But you only insured it for $100,000 to save on premiums. Now you have a $50,000 fire. Instead of paying the full $50,000, insurance calculates: (Amount of insurance you bought / Amount you should have bought) × Loss = Payment. So: ($100,000 / $160,000) × $50,000 = $31,250. You only get $31,250 instead of $50,000! The penalty is because you under-insured. The lesson: Always insure your property for at least 80% of its replacement cost, or you'll face a coinsurance penalty on claims.",

A Broker, on the other hand, works for the customer and must take the application to an insurance company for approval - they can't bind coverage themselves. An Adjuster investigates and settles claims. An Underwriter works for the company and decides whether to accept risks and at what price. Example: You call an agent about homeowners insurance.

Because it's a catastrophic peril that can affect huge areas at once. If a major earthquake hits, thousands of homes are damaged simultaneously - no insurance company could handle that risk in their regular policies. If you live in earthquake-prone areas (like California, or parts of the Southeast near fault lines), you need to buy separate earthquake insurance or add it as an endorsement.

This doesn't mean they'll PAY the claim in 10 days - just that they must confirm they got it. After acknowledgment, they must begin investigating promptly and must communicate regularly about the claim's status.

Or worse: the association is sued and their insurance isn't enough - they assess each owner $5,000 to cover the shortfall.

                explanation: "The Liberalization Clause is a great benefit for policyholders! Here's how it works: You buy a homeowners policy on January 1st. In March, your insurance company files new, improved policy forms with the state that give broader coverage (maybe they added a new covered peril or increased certain limits). Normally, you'd have to wait until your policy renews to get the better coverage. But the Liberalization Clause says: If we file broader coverage at the same premium, you AUTOMATICALLY get the improvement right away, even though you're in the middle of your policy term. You don't have to ask for it or pay extra. The company can't offer better coverage to new customers while giving you the old, worse coverage. This protects existing customers from being left behind when improvements are made.",

                explanation: "Direct Physical Loss means actual, tangible damage to physical property that you can see and touch. Example of DIRECT physical loss: A tree falls on your house and damages the roof - you can see the broken shingles and hole. Fire burns your furniture - you can see the burnt items. Water floods your basement - you can see the wet carpet and damaged drywall. Example of INDIRECT loss: Your restaurant has a fire and must close for 2 months. You lose $50,000 in profits - that's an indirect financial loss, not direct physical damage. Most property policies require 'direct physical loss' to trigger coverage. This has been controversial with COVID-19 business interruption claims - businesses argued they had loss of use, but many courts said there was no 'direct physical loss' because the virus didn't physically damage the building.",

                explanation: "These are two different ways to settle claims. REPLACEMENT COST: The insurance company calculates what it costs to rebuild/replace at the time of the loss. If your house burns down and lumber prices have doubled, they pay the current higher price to rebuild. This protects you from inflation. AGREED VALUE: You and the insurance company agree upfront on a specific value (like $500,000) and that's what they'll pay regardless of actual rebuilding costs. This is used for things that are hard to value, like antique cars, artwork, or unique historic buildings. Why use Agreed Value? It avoids disputes about value after a loss. You both already agreed. But there's a risk: If costs go up (inflation), you might not get enough to rebuild. Replacement Cost adjusts with the market. Most standard homeowners policies use Replacement Cost. Agreed Value is for special situations.",

                explanation: "Concurrent Causation is when multiple causes (perils) work together to create a loss, and some are covered while others are excluded. This creates disputes! Example: An earthquake (excluded) cracks your foundation and breaks a water pipe. Water floods and damages your house. Is this covered? The earthquake (excluded) and water damage (normally covered) both contributed. Old rule: If ANY cause was covered, the loss was covered. Insurance companies didn't like this. New rule (most policies now): If any cause is excluded, the ENTIRE loss is excluded.

They're now a 'permissive user' and your insurance covers them if they have an accident. You don't need to call your insurance company or add them to your policy - permission is automatic.

If you MISS the deer but hit something else (tree, ditch, guardrail, another car) = Collision. Why? Because you (and your moving car) collided with an object. It doesn't matter WHY you hit the tree - the fact is your car hit a fixed object, which is the definition of Collision. The customer will pay their Collision deductible (often $500-$1,000) and insurance will pay to fix or replace the car. Pro tip: From a claims perspective, it's actually better to hit the deer (Comprehensive, lower deductible) than to swerve and hit a tree (Collision, higher deductible)! But safety first - never risk your life to save on a deductible!",

Hail just falls from the sky - your car wasn't moving and hitting anything. The customer pays their Comprehensive deductible.

                answers: [
                    "Yes, fully covered",
                    "Probably not - most policies limit coverage after 30-60 days vacancy",

                correct: 3,
                explanation: "This is a BIG problem! Most homeowners policies have 'vacancy clauses' that significantly limit or exclude coverage if the property is vacant (empty of both people AND belongings) for more than 30-60 consecutive days. Why? Vacant properties are MUCH riskier - no one's there to notice problems, vandals target them, pipes can freeze unnoticed, etc. If you were renovating for 90 days without telling your insurance company, they might: (1) Deny the claim entirely, or (2) Pay reduced benefits, or (3) Exclude certain perils like vandalism and theft. The RIGHT thing to do: Call your agent BEFORE the renovation. Get a 'Vacant Property' or 'Builders Risk' policy, or get an endorsement allowing the vacancy. It costs extra but maintains coverage. Never assume your regular policy covers long vacancies!",
                simpleAnswer: "Probably denied - Policies typically exclude or limit coverage after 30-60 days of vacancy. MUST notify insurance for renovations or long absences."

                explanation: "Sewer and drain backup is specifically EXCLUDED from standard homeowners policies! This surprises many people. Why? Because it's considered a maintenance issue and very expensive. Insurance companies don't want to cover problems that might be prevented by proper upkeep. However, you CAN (and should!) buy 'Water Backup Coverage' as an endorsement for usually $50-100 per year. This adds coverage for sewer backup, sump pump failure, and drain overflow - typically with limits of $5,000-$25,000. Without this endorsement, the customer would pay out of pocket for everything: cleanup, repairs, replacing belongings. Sewage cleanup can cost $10,000-30,000 easily. This is one of the most important endorsements to have! North Carolina has clay soil and older sewer systems in many areas, making this a common problem.",

But here's the challenge: many companies now exclude certain 'dangerous breeds' or charge extra for them. And if your dog has bitten before, you might be excluded. For a $50,000 lawsuit, Coverage E pays. For small injuries, Medical Payments (Coverage F) can pay quickly without a lawsuit (up to $1,000-$5,000).

If they cause a major accident, it goes on YOUR policy, YOUR rates might increase, and if damages exceed YOUR limits, YOU could be sued personally.

Here's the rule: The policy doesn't cover the cost to FIX the AC unit itself (that's maintenance), but it DOES cover the damage the AC unit caused (the ruined floors). So: Insurance does NOT pay to repair/replace the AC unit. Insurance DOES pay to replace the damaged hardwood floors (under Coverage A - Dwelling). You pay your deductible.

Plus, filing a claim (especially at-fault) can raise your rates by 20-40% for 3-5 years. That rate increase might cost you $500-1,000 total over time - way more than the $200 payout! Many experienced agents recommend: If damages are less than $1,500-$2,000, consider paying out of pocket to avoid a rate increase. But you MUST report the accident to your insurance company even if you don't file a claim (policy requirement). Just say 'I'm reporting this but not filing a claim.'

If both insurance companies agree it's 50/50 fault, each company might try to recover 50% from the other.
