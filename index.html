                    <div class="alert-content" style="color: #155724;">
                        <p><strong>Think of coinsurance as an "honesty check"</strong> that makes sure you're insuring your property for its real value.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Here's the deal:</strong></p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                            <li>Most policies require you to insure your property for AT LEAST 80% of what it would cost to rebuild/replace</li>
                            <li>If you under-insure (carry less than 80%), you get PENALIZED at claim time</li>
                            <li>The penalty means insurance won't pay the full claim - YOU pay the difference!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Why do insurance companies care?</strong><br>
                        Because if you only insure a $500,000 building for $200,000 and pay lower premiums, that's not fair. The coinsurance clause makes sure everyone pays their fair share.</p>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurance Pays = (Amount Carried ÷ Amount Required) × Loss Amount<br>

                        <p><strong>ACV = What something is worth TODAY after years of use</strong></p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Simple formula:</strong></p>
                        <div style="background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 10px 0; font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">
                            ACV = Replacement Cost - Depreciation
                        </div>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Example:</strong> Your TV cost $2,000 new. Today, a similar new TV costs $1,500 (replacement cost). Your TV is 3 years old and worth 40% less (depreciation). ACV = $1,500 - ($1,500 × 40%) = $1,500 - $600 = <strong>$900</strong></p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> If your policy pays ACV (not Replacement Cost), you get the depreciated value. You'd receive $900 for a TV that costs $1,500 to replace - you pay $600 out-of-pocket!</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>Replacement Cost coverage is better</strong> - it pays the full cost to replace with new (minus deductible), but costs more in premiums.</p>

                question: "A homeowner leaves oily rags piled up in their garage, making it easier for a fire to start. What type of problem is this?",
                answers: ["Physical Hazard", "Moral Hazard", "Morale Hazard", "Legal Hazard"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Think of a Physical Hazard as something you can see or touch that makes an accident more likely. Oily rags are a real, physical thing that can catch fire. A Moral Hazard would be if someone intentionally tried to cause damage. A Morale Hazard is when someone is careless because they have insurance.",
                simpleAnswer: "Physical Hazard - It's a real, physical thing you can see that makes an accident more likely to happen.",

                difficulty: "easy"
            },
            {
                question: "After paying a customer's claim, the insurance company wants to go after the person who actually caused the damage to get their money back. What is this called?",
                answers: ["Indemnity", "Contribution", "Subrogation", "Insurable Interest"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Subrogation is when the insurance company 'steps into your shoes' after paying your claim. Your insurance pays you $50,000 for fire damage caused by your neighbor's negligence. Now YOUR insurance company has the right to sue your neighbor to recover that $50,000. They're taking over YOUR right to sue.",
                simpleAnswer: "Subrogation - The insurance company takes your place and goes after whoever caused the damage to get their money back.",

                question: "Which one of these is something you could either win or lose money on? (Not something insurance covers)",
                answers: ["Your home being damaged by a hurricane", "Your car being stolen", "Losing money in the stock market", "Getting sick and needing a doctor"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Insurance only covers 'Pure Risks' - situations where you can only lose money or stay the same, never win money. The stock market is a 'Speculative Risk' - you might lose money OR make money! Insurance never covers gambling or investments because you chose to take that risk hoping to make money.",
                simpleAnswer: "Stock market - It's the only one where you could either make money or lose money. Insurance only covers things where you can only lose.",

            },
            {
                question: "Why can insurance companies predict how many claims they'll get? What rule helps them?",
                answers: ["Principle of Indemnity", "Law of Large Numbers", "Doctrine of Proximate Cause", "Concept of Adverse Selection"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Law of Large Numbers is like flipping a coin. If you flip it 10 times, results are random. But if you flip it 10,000 times, you'll get very close to 50/50. With 100,000 houses, insurance companies can predict very accurately how many will have fires, thefts, or storm damage each year.",
                simpleAnswer: "Law of Large Numbers - The more houses (or cars, etc.) an insurance company covers, the easier it is to predict how many claims will happen.",

                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "What part of an insurance policy contains the company's main promise to pay you if something bad happens?",
                answers: ["Declarations", "Insuring Agreement", "Conditions", "Exclusions"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Insuring Agreement is where the insurance company promises 'We will pay for these specific things if they happen to you.' The Declarations page is just the info page. The Conditions are the rules you both must follow. The Exclusions are the 'we will NOT pay for these things' list.",
                simpleAnswer: "Insuring Agreement - This is where the insurance company makes their main promise to pay you for covered losses.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "easy"
            },
            {
                question: "Someone lies on their insurance application, saying they have a burglar alarm when they really don't. What is this lie called?",
                answers: ["Warranty", "Waiver", "Misrepresentation", "Condition"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "A Misrepresentation is telling a lie or giving wrong information. If it's important information (like lying about having an alarm), it's a 'Material Misrepresentation' and the insurance company can cancel your policy. A Warranty is a promise that something is 100% true. A Waiver is giving up a right you have.",
                simpleAnswer: "Misrepresentation - This means lying or giving wrong information on your application.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "The insurance company writes the entire policy, and you can either accept it as-is or not buy it. What kind of contract is this?",
                answers: ["Unilateral Contract", "Aleatory Contract", "Conditional Contract", "Contract of Adhesion"],
                correct: 3,
                explanation: "A Contract of Adhesion is a 'take it or leave it' deal. The insurance company writes everything, and you can't negotiate. Because of this, if something in the policy is confusing, the courts will side with YOU, not the big insurance company. A Unilateral Contract means only one party makes promises. An Aleatory Contract means the money exchanged isn't equal.",
                simpleAnswer: "Contract of Adhesion - A 'take it or leave it' deal where the insurance company wrote everything and you can't change any words.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "You pay $1,200 per year for insurance, and the insurance company's promise is based on what you paid and what you said in your application. What is this payment and these statements called?",
                answers: ["Offer", "Acceptance", "Consideration", "Legal Purpose"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Consideration is what each side gives up to make a contract valid. YOUR consideration is two things: (1) the money you pay (premiums) and (2) the truthful statements you made. The INSURANCE COMPANY'S consideration is their promise to pay if something bad happens. Both sides must give something for the contract to be real.",
                simpleAnswer: "Consideration - This is what you give (your money and truthful information) and what they give (promise to pay claims) to make the deal valid.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "What does 'Utmost Good Faith' mean in insurance?",
                answers: ["The insurance company always believes the customer", "Both parties must be completely honest and disclose all important facts", "Only the insurance company has to be honest", "It means getting the cheapest price"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Utmost Good Faith means both you AND the insurance company must be super honest - even MORE honest than in regular business deals. Insurance is based on trust. If you lie about having a burglar alarm, you're breaking this principle. But the insurance company must also be honest about coverage and pay claims fairly.",
                simpleAnswer: "Both sides must be totally honest - You and the insurance company both have a duty to be completely truthful about all important facts.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "What does 'Proximate Cause' mean in insurance?",
                answers: ["The closest fire station to your house", "The direct, unbroken chain of events that led to the loss", "The approximate cost of repairs", "The insurance company's estimate"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Proximate Cause means finding the DIRECT cause of damage in an unbroken chain. Example: Lightning strikes house → starts fire → fire spreads to furniture → furniture destroyed. The proximate cause is lightning, even though fire destroyed the furniture. Another example: Earthquake → breaks gas line → causes fire → burns house. Proximate cause? The earthquake! So even though fire is normally covered, this wouldn't be because the earthquake (excluded) was the first domino.",
                simpleAnswer: "The original cause that started everything - The first event in the chain that directly led to the damage, even if other things happened in between.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "hard"
            },
            {
                question: "If two insurance policies cover the same property for the same peril and a loss occurs, which principle prevents the insured from collecting from both and making a profit?",
                answers: ["Subrogation", "Contribution", "Indemnity", "Insurable Interest"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Contribution prevents you from making money off insurance by having multiple policies. Example: You own a house worth $200,000. You accidentally insure it with TWO companies, each for $200,000. A fire causes $100,000 damage. Each company pays their PROPORTIONAL share ($50,000 each), so you get $100,000 total - exactly enough to fix the damage, not a penny more.",
                simpleAnswer: "Contribution - When you have multiple policies on the same property, each pays its fair share so you don't collect more than your actual loss.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "hard"
            },
            {
                question: "What is the purpose of an 'Insurable Interest'?",
                answers: ["To make insurance more interesting", "To prevent people from insuring property they don't have a financial stake in", "To calculate the interest on insurance premiums", "To determine the interest rate for payment plans"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Insurable Interest prevents gambling with insurance. You can only insure something if you would suffer a REAL financial loss if it were damaged. You can insure YOUR house because if it burns, you lose money. But you can't insure your neighbor's house because you have no financial stake in it. Without this rule, people could insure random properties hoping they'd be destroyed!",
                simpleAnswer: "No gambling allowed - You can only insure things where you'd actually lose money if they were damaged or destroyed (prevents betting on other people's property).",

                difficulty: "medium"
            },
            {
                question: "Adverse Selection in insurance means:",
                answers: ["Insurance companies selecting only the best risks", "People with higher risks seeking insurance more aggressively than those with lower risks", "Customers choosing the cheapest insurance", "Insurance companies denying claims"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Adverse Selection is when people who KNOW they're high-risk are more likely to buy insurance than people who are low-risk. Someone in a flood zone wants flood insurance more than someone on a hill. Someone with car accident history wants insurance more than a perfect driver. If insurance companies don't protect against this, they'd end up with ONLY high-risk customers, causing massive losses.",
                simpleAnswer: "High-risk people want insurance more - People who know they're likely to have claims seek insurance more aggressively than low-risk people, creating an imbalance.",
                topic: "General Insurance Concepts",
                difficulty: "hard"
            },
            {
                question: "Which of these statements about an insurance policy is TRUE?",
                answers: ["The insured can stop paying premiums anytime, but the insurer must continue coverage", "Both parties can cancel anytime for any reason", "The insured must pay all premiums first, then file claims", "Only the insured makes legally binding promises"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "This describes a 'Unilateral Contract.' Only the insurance company makes a legally enforceable promise: 'If you have a covered loss, we WILL pay.' You don't promise to pay premiums! You can stop paying anytime and they'll just cancel your policy. They can't sue you for future premiums. Compare to a lease where both you AND the landlord make promises - both parties are locked in.",
                simpleAnswer: "Only the insurance company makes binding promises - You can stop paying and cancel anytime, but if you have a covered loss, they MUST pay as promised.",

                question: "What is a 'Peril' in insurance terms?",
                answers: ["A dangerous situation", "The specific cause of a loss (like fire, wind, theft)", "A pearl necklace coverage", "The chance of loss"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "A Peril is simply the CAUSE of a loss - the specific event or thing that damaged your property. Common perils: fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, theft, vandalism. Insurance policies either list specific covered perils ('Named Peril') or cover all perils except excluded ones ('Open Peril'). Whenever you see 'peril,' just think 'cause of damage' or 'type of claim.'",
                simpleAnswer: "Peril = Type of damage/cause of loss - Just a fancy word for what caused the damage (fire, theft, wind, etc.). Each policy lists which perils it covers.",

                question: "What is the difference between 'Replacement Cost' and 'Agreed Value'?",
                answers: ["They are the same thing", "Replacement Cost pays to rebuild; Agreed Value is a pre-set amount both parties agreed to", "Agreed Value is always less than Replacement Cost", "Replacement Cost includes depreciation"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "REPLACEMENT COST: The insurance company calculates what it costs to rebuild/replace at the time of the loss. If lumber prices doubled, they pay the current higher price. AGREED VALUE: You and the company agree upfront on a specific value (like $500,000) and that's what they'll pay regardless of actual costs. Used for antique cars, artwork, or unique historic buildings. Replacement Cost adjusts with the market. Agreed Value is locked in.",
                simpleAnswer: "Replacement Cost adjusts with market; Agreed Value is locked in - RC pays whatever it costs now to rebuild, AV pays a pre-set dollar amount you both agreed to at policy start.",

                question: "What is an 'Endorsement' in insurance?",
                answers: ["A celebrity promoting insurance", "A written form that changes or adds to the policy terms", "Your signature on the policy", "The company endorsing a claim"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "An Endorsement (also called 'Rider' or 'Floater') is a document that modifies your policy - adds coverage, removes coverage, or changes terms. Common endorsements: Scheduled Personal Property (jewelry coverage), Earthquake Coverage, Water Backup Coverage, Increased Limits, Named Driver Exclusion. When an endorsement conflicts with the main policy, the endorsement wins. They usually cost extra if adding coverage, or give discount if removing.",
                simpleAnswer: "A policy change form - A written attachment that adds, removes, or modifies coverage on your policy (like adding earthquake coverage or increasing limits).",

                question: "What is the difference between a 'Claim' and a 'Loss'?",
                answers: ["They mean the same thing", "A loss is the event that causes damage; a claim is your request for payment", "A claim is bigger than a loss", "You report losses but not claims"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "LOSS = The actual event that caused damage (fire burns house, thief steals TV, storm damages roof). CLAIM = Your formal request to the insurance company to pay for the loss. Example: Lightning strikes house Friday (LOSS). Monday you call insurance asking them to pay for repairs (CLAIM). Not all losses result in claims - if damage is less than deductible, you might not file a claim.",
                simpleAnswer: "Loss is the damage event, claim is the payment request - The loss is what happened to your property; the claim is when you ask insurance to pay for it.",

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Depreciation is how much value something loses as it gets older and used. A 5-year-old car is worth less than a new car. A 10-year-old roof is worth less than a new roof. Insurance uses this to calculate ACV (Actual Cash Value). Example: New couch costs $1,000. After 5 years, it's depreciated 40%. Now it's worth $600 (60% of original). With ACV coverage, you'd get $600. With Replacement Cost coverage, you'd get $1,000.",

One accident injures 5 people totaling $400,000. Insurance pays $300,000 max (you owe $100,000). All 5 people share the $300,000. If you cause TWO separate accidents, each gets its own $300,000 limit. 'Per Occurrence' is different from 'Aggregate' which is your total limit for the whole policy period.",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Rebating is strictly illegal in NC and most states. If agents could offer cash or gifts, it would become a bidding war. Agents would compete by offering bigger bribes instead of better service or coverage. Insurance agents must compete based on service and knowledge, not bribes.

The insured must knowingly waive their right to jury trial. Arbitration clauses cannot be hidden in fine print. For Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist coverage specifically, NC law requires an arbitration provision, but the insured can reject it in writing.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "NC has a Valued Policy Law that applies specifically to TOTAL LOSSES by FIRE. If a building is completely destroyed by fire, the insurance company must pay the full policy limit (face amount) stated in the policy, regardless of the actual value. This prevents disputes over value after a total fire loss. However, this ONLY applies to: (1) Total losses, not partial, (2) Fire losses specifically, (3) Buildings, not contents.

                explanation: "TRICK QUESTION! NC does NOT use Pure Comparative Negligence. NC uses 'CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE' - one of only a few states that does. Under contributory negligence, if you are even 1% at fault for an accident, you cannot recover ANY damages from the other party. This is very harsh for plaintiffs. Example: You're 5% at fault, other driver is 95% at fault. In NC, you get ZERO. Most states use comparative negligence where your recovery is just reduced by your fault percentage.",

Without it: House worth $500K, insured for $400K, 80% coinsurance clause, $100K loss → penalty applies because you should have $400K minimum (80% of $500K).

They DON'T have to replace the entire set. Example: You have matching dining room chairs worth $5,000 for 8 chairs ($625 each). One is damaged. Insurer pays $625, not $5,000.

                question: "If you accidentally run a red light and hit another car, injuring the other driver, which part of your auto insurance pays for the other driver's injuries?",
                answers: ["Part A - Liability Coverage", "Part B - Medical Payments Coverage", "Part C - Uninsured Motorist Coverage", "Part D - Collision Coverage"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Part A - Liability Coverage pays for damage YOU cause to OTHER people and their property. When you hurt someone else or damage their car because you messed up, your Liability coverage pays for their medical bills, car repairs, lost wages, etc. It also pays for a lawyer if they sue you. This is the ONLY coverage required by law in NC.",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Theft is covered under Comprehensive (Other Than Collision). Rule: Collision = you hit something or something hits you. Comprehensive = almost everything else! Theft, fire, hail, vandalism, hitting an animal, glass breakage, flood, etc. Theft is NOT a collision - someone took your car. That's Comprehensive.",
                simpleAnswer: "Part D - Comprehensive - Theft is covered under Comprehensive (Other Than Collision), which covers damage that's not from crashing into something.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The PAP has 4 standardized parts: Part A = Liability (covers damage you cause to others), Part B = Medical Payments (pays medical bills for you/passengers), Part C = Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (protects you from uninsured drivers), Part D = Physical Damage to your car (Collision + Comprehensive). These are universal across all states, though some states require certain parts.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Split limits are expressed as three numbers (e.g., 50/100/50 means $50,000/$100,000/$50,000). First number: Maximum per person for bodily injury. Second number: Maximum per accident total for all bodily injuries. Third number: Maximum for property damage per accident. Example: 3 people hurt in crash, $60K + $50K + $40K = $150K total. You pay: $50K + $50K + $40K = $140K (within per-person limits), but total injuries limited to $100K, so $40K unpaid. Property separate.",

On July 1, 2025, minimums increase to 50/100/50. These minimums ensure all drivers have SOME financial responsibility. Liability coverage is MANDATORY in NC - you cannot legally drive without it.",

Their Collision coverage could pay for their car if they have it (then their insurer would subrogate against you). Liability always pays for damage you cause to OTHERS.",

                explanation: "Med Pay (Part B) is NO-FAULT coverage. It pays reasonable medical expenses for you and passengers injured in your vehicle, regardless of who caused the accident. Also covers you as a pedestrian hit by a car, or while riding in someone else's car. Common limits: $1,000-$5,000. Pays quickly without waiting for liability determination.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "UM coverage protects YOU when you're hit by: (1) Uninsured driver, (2) Hit-and-run driver, (3) Driver whose insurer is insolvent. UM Bodily Injury pays for your injuries. UM Property Damage pays for your car (less common, since Collision covers this). UM basically acts like the at-fault driver HAD insurance. In NC, you must be OFFERED UM coverage - you can reject it in writing but it's not smart to.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "UIM pays when the at-fault driver HAS insurance, but not enough. Example: You're hurt, damages total $100K. At-fault driver has minimum 30/60 ($30K per person max). They pay $30K. Your UIM pays the remaining $70K (up to your UIM limits). Without UIM, you'd sue the driver personally for $70K - good luck collecting! UIM is crucial when you have high injury costs.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "COLLISION: Damage from hitting another vehicle or object (tree, guardrail, building), OR being hit by another vehicle, OR rollover. COMPREHENSIVE (Other Than Collision): Theft, fire, vandalism, glass breakage, hail, flood, hitting an animal, falling objects, civil commotion. Simple rule: If you HIT something or something HITS you = Collision. Almost everything else = Comprehensive.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Hitting ANY animal (deer, dog, moose, etc.) is ALWAYS Comprehensive, never Collision. This is a specific rule in the policy. Animals are unpredictable 'acts of nature' like weather. Even though you technically 'collided' with the deer, insurance treats it as Comprehensive. Remember: Animals → Comprehensive!",

For new cars: Liability automatically extends. Collision/Comp only extend if you already have it on another car and you notify insurer within the time period.",

Example: Friend borrows your car with permission - your liability coverage protects them. Your teenager living at home - covered as family member.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Stacking allows combining UM limits from multiple insured vehicles. NON-STACKED: 3 cars, $50K UM each. You're hit by uninsured driver, hurt badly, $120K damages. You collect max $50K. STACKED: Same 3 cars. You combine limits: $50K × 3 = $150K available. You collect $120K. Stacking costs more in premium but gives better protection.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "When new parts are installed, your car may be 'better' than before. Insurer may apply betterment/depreciation deduction. Example: Your 8-year-old car needs new tires after accident. New tires are better than worn tires. Insurer pays for new tires MINUS depreciation for the wear on the old tires. With Actual Cash Value (ACV), depreciation is standard. With new car replacement or stated value, less depreciation applied.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Total Loss declared when: (1) Repair cost + salvage value ≥ Actual Cash Value, OR (2) Repair cost ≥ State threshold (often 75-80% of ACV). Example: Car ACV = $10,000. Repairs = $8,500. In state with 80% threshold, that's a total loss. Insurer pays ACV minus deductible, takes the car. You can sometimes 'buy back' the salvage. Not about complete destruction - about economics.",

                explanation: "Rental Reimbursement is optional coverage paying daily amount ($30-$50 typical) for rental car while your covered vehicle is being repaired OR stolen and not recovered. Usually has per-day and total limits ($30/day, $900 total = 30 days max). Does NOT cover: rental cars on vacation (that's in the PAP automatically), or delays in getting repairs done.

Used when: (1) High-risk driver in household (DUI, terrible record), (2) Person has own insurance, (3) Unlicensed person. Reduces premium significantly. BUT - if excluded person drives and has accident, NO COVERAGE for any damages! Must be signed acknowledgment. Dangerous - should only exclude someone who absolutely will not drive vehicle.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Diminished Value (DV) is the reduction in market value because car has accident history, even with perfect repairs. Example: Car worth $30K. After accident, repaired perfectly for $8K. But now worth only $26K because CarFax shows accident. Lost $4K in value = Diminished Value. Some states require insurers to pay DV in first-party claims (your own Collision). Most don't. You can always pursue DV against at-fault party in third-party claims.",

Required for: DUI/DWI, driving without insurance, too many points, serious accidents while uninsured. Duration: Typically 3 years. If coverage lapses, insurer notifies DMV and license suspended.

STEP 4: $75,000 - $2,000 deductible = $73,000 paid. BONUS INFO: Carrying 100% of value (or more) means you're fully protected and will NEVER face coinsurance penalties. However, you pay higher premiums for that extra coverage.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "FLOOD INSURANCE COSTS vary by zone and coverage: '100-year flood zone' (Zone A or AE) = 1% annual flood chance = HIGH RISK. TYPICAL COSTS for $250K structure / $100K contents: PREFERRED ZONE (X - low risk): $400-$600/year. MODERATE ZONE (Zone B/C/X-shaded): $600-$1,200/year. HIGH RISK ZONE (Zone A/AE/V): $1,000-$3,000/year. V ZONE (coastal high hazard): $3,000-$10,000+/year. COVERAGE LIMITS: Max $250K structure, $100K contents through NFIP. WAITING PERIOD: 30 days from purchase to coverage effective. MORTGAGE REQUIREMENT: Lenders REQUIRE flood insurance for properties in high-risk zones. Post-Florence, many NC properties remapped into higher risk zones = premium increases. Private flood insurance now available, sometimes cheaper than NFIP!",
                simpleAnswer: "$1,000-$3,000/year - 100-year flood zone = high risk. Cost depends on: flood zone, elevation, coverage amount, deductible. Mortgage lender will REQUIRE it.",

                explanation: "RULE: When cause is uncertain between two covered perils, USE THE LOWER DEDUCTIBLE OR MOST FAVORABLE TO INSURED! Policy ambiguity is interpreted in favor of insured (remember: Contract of Adhesion). REASONING: (1) Insurance company wrote the policy, (2) They could have been more specific about deductibles, (3) Ambiguity resolved in homeowner's favor, (4) Apply $1,000 hail deductible (most favorable). PRACTICAL: Adjusters will investigate thoroughly to determine actual cause. Wind and hail cause different damage patterns.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "RESERVATION OF RIGHTS letter means: 'We're investigating/defending you now, but we're not admitting coverage. We may deny later if we find exclusions apply.' Example: Claim involves possible intentional damage (excluded). Insurer investigates while reserving right to deny if they prove it was intentional. Protects insurer from waiving defenses. Protects you because they continue defense. If you receive this, consider hiring your own attorney - coverage may be denied after they investigate.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "LIBERALIZATION CLAUSE: If during your policy period, the insurer adopts broader coverage without additional premium, your existing policy automatically gets the broader coverage too - no waiting for renewal! Example: Your policy starts Jan 1. On June 1, insurer files new forms with broader coverage at same rate. Your policy automatically updates to broader coverage on June 1 even though renewal isn't until next January.

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "DEDUCTIBLE purposes: (1) LOWER PREMIUMS: You assume first $X of loss, premium is cheaper. (2) ELIMINATE SMALL CLAIMS: Insurer doesn't process $200 claims with $500 deductible, reducing administrative costs. (3) MORAL HAZARD REDUCTION: You have 'skin in the game' so you're still careful. (4) KEEPS PREMIUMS STABLE: Fewer small claims means more stable rates. Common: $500-$2,500 property, $250-$1,000 auto. Higher deductible = lower premium. Applies per claim/occurrence.",

                explanation: "APPRAISAL CLAUSE: When you and insurer AGREE coverage exists but DISAGREE on value/amount of damage, either party can invoke appraisal. Process: (1) Each party selects an appraiser, (2) Appraisers select an umpire, (3) Both appraisers inspect and value damage, (4) If they agree, that's the value, (5) If they disagree, umpire decides, (6) Decision is binding.

                        2. <strong>Consider an "Agreed Amount" endorsement</strong> - This waives the coinsurance clause (insurance agrees your current amount is adequate)<br>
                        3. <strong>Review your coverage annually</strong> - Property values increase over time, so your coverage needs to increase too!
