                question: "A homeowner leaves oily rags piled up in their garage, making it easier for a fire to start. What type of problem is this?",
                answers: ["Physical Hazard", "Moral Hazard", "Morale Hazard", "Legal Hazard"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Think of a Physical Hazard as something you can see or touch that makes an accident more likely. Oily rags are a real, physical thing that can catch fire. A Moral Hazard would be if someone intentionally tried to cause damage. A Morale Hazard is when someone is careless because they have insurance.",
                simpleAnswer: "Physical Hazard - It's a real, physical thing you can see that makes an accident more likely to happen.",

                question: "After paying a customer's claim, the insurance company wants to go after the person who actually caused the damage to get their money back. What is this called?",
                answers: ["Indemnity", "Contribution", "Subrogation", "Insurable Interest"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Subrogation is when the insurance company 'steps into your shoes' after paying your claim. Your insurance pays you $50,000 for fire damage caused by your neighbor's negligence. Now YOUR insurance company has the right to sue your neighbor to recover that $50,000. They're taking over YOUR right to sue.",
                simpleAnswer: "Subrogation - The insurance company takes your place and goes after whoever caused the damage to get their money back.",

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Insurance only covers 'Pure Risks' - situations where you can only lose money or stay the same, never win money. The stock market is a 'Speculative Risk' - you might lose money OR make money! Insurance never covers gambling or investments because you chose to take that risk hoping to make money.",
                simpleAnswer: "Stock market - It's the only one where you could either make money or lose money. Insurance only covers things where you can only lose.",

                question: "Why can insurance companies predict how many claims they'll get? What rule helps them?",
                answers: ["Principle of Indemnity", "Law of Large Numbers", "Doctrine of Proximate Cause", "Concept of Adverse Selection"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Law of Large Numbers is like flipping a coin. If you flip it 10 times, results are random. But if you flip it 10,000 times, you'll get very close to 50/50. With 100,000 houses, insurance companies can predict very accurately how many will have fires, thefts, or storm damage each year.",
                simpleAnswer: "Law of Large Numbers - The more houses (or cars, etc.) an insurance company covers, the easier it is to predict how many claims will happen.",

                question: "What part of an insurance policy contains the company's main promise to pay you if something bad happens?",
                answers: ["Declarations", "Insuring Agreement", "Conditions", "Exclusions"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "The Insuring Agreement is where the insurance company promises 'We will pay for these specific things if they happen to you.' The Declarations page is just the info page. The Conditions are the rules you both must follow. The Exclusions are the 'we will NOT pay for these things' list.",
                simpleAnswer: "Insuring Agreement - This is where the insurance company makes their main promise to pay you for covered losses.",

                answers: ["Warranty", "Waiver", "Misrepresentation", "Condition"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "A Misrepresentation is telling a lie or giving wrong information. If it's important information (like lying about having an alarm), it's a 'Material Misrepresentation' and the insurance company can cancel your policy. A Warranty is a promise that something is 100% true. A Waiver is giving up a right you have.",
                simpleAnswer: "Misrepresentation - This means lying or giving wrong information on your application.",

                answers: ["Unilateral Contract", "Aleatory Contract", "Conditional Contract", "Contract of Adhesion"],
                correct: 3,
                explanation: "A Contract of Adhesion is a 'take it or leave it' deal. The insurance company writes everything, and you can't negotiate. Because of this, if something in the policy is confusing, the courts will side with YOU, not the big insurance company. A Unilateral Contract means only one party makes promises. An Aleatory Contract means the money exchanged isn't equal.",
                simpleAnswer: "Contract of Adhesion - A 'take it or leave it' deal where the insurance company wrote everything and you can't change any words.",

                question: "You pay $1,200 per year for insurance, and the insurance company's promise is based on what you paid and what you said in your application. What is this payment and these statements called?",
                answers: ["Offer", "Acceptance", "Consideration", "Legal Purpose"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Consideration is what each side gives up to make a contract valid. YOUR consideration is two things: (1) the money you pay (premiums) and (2) the truthful statements you made. The INSURANCE COMPANY'S consideration is their promise to pay if something bad happens. Both sides must give something for the contract to be real.",
                simpleAnswer: "Consideration - This is what you give (your money and truthful information) and what they give (promise to pay claims) to make the deal valid.",

                question: "What does 'Utmost Good Faith' mean in insurance?",
                answers: ["The insurance company always believes the customer", "Both parties must be completely honest and disclose all important facts", "Only the insurance company has to be honest", "It means getting the cheapest price"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Utmost Good Faith means both you AND the insurance company must be super honest - even MORE honest than in regular business deals. Insurance is based on trust. If you lie about having a burglar alarm, you're breaking this principle. But the insurance company must also be honest about coverage and pay claims fairly.",
                simpleAnswer: "Both sides must be totally honest - You and the insurance company both have a duty to be completely truthful about all important facts.",

                question: "What does 'Proximate Cause' mean in insurance?",
                answers: ["The closest fire station to your house", "The direct, unbroken chain of events that led to the loss", "The approximate cost of repairs", "The insurance company's estimate"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Proximate Cause means finding the DIRECT cause of damage in an unbroken chain. Example: Lightning strikes house → starts fire → fire spreads to furniture → furniture destroyed. The proximate cause is lightning, even though fire destroyed the furniture. Another example: Earthquake → breaks gas line → causes fire → burns house. Proximate cause? The earthquake! So even though fire is normally covered, this wouldn't be because the earthquake (excluded) was the first domino.",
                simpleAnswer: "The original cause that started everything - The first event in the chain that directly led to the damage, even if other things happened in between.",

                question: "If two insurance policies cover the same property for the same peril and a loss occurs, which principle prevents the insured from collecting from both and making a profit?",
                answers: ["Subrogation", "Contribution", "Indemnity", "Insurable Interest"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Contribution prevents you from making money off insurance by having multiple policies. Example: You own a house worth $200,000. You accidentally insure it with TWO companies, each for $200,000. A fire causes $100,000 damage. Each company pays their PROPORTIONAL share ($50,000 each), so you get $100,000 total - exactly enough to fix the damage, not a penny more.",
                simpleAnswer: "Contribution - When you have multiple policies on the same property, each pays its fair share so you don't collect more than your actual loss.",

                difficulty: "hard"
            },
            {
                question: "What is the purpose of an 'Insurable Interest'?",
                answers: ["To make insurance more interesting", "To prevent people from insuring property they don't have a financial stake in", "To calculate the interest on insurance premiums", "To determine the interest rate for payment plans"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Insurable Interest prevents gambling with insurance. You can only insure something if you would suffer a REAL financial loss if it were damaged. You can insure YOUR house because if it burns, you lose money. But you can't insure your neighbor's house because you have no financial stake in it. Without this rule, people could insure random properties hoping they'd be destroyed!",
                simpleAnswer: "No gambling allowed - You can only insure things where you'd actually lose money if they were damaged or destroyed (prevents betting on other people's property).",

                question: "Adverse Selection in insurance means:",
                answers: ["Insurance companies selecting only the best risks", "People with higher risks seeking insurance more aggressively than those with lower risks", "Customers choosing the cheapest insurance", "Insurance companies denying claims"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Adverse Selection is when people who KNOW they're high-risk are more likely to buy insurance than people who are low-risk. Someone in a flood zone wants flood insurance more than someone on a hill. Someone with car accident history wants insurance more than a perfect driver. If insurance companies don't protect against this, they'd end up with ONLY high-risk customers, causing massive losses.",
                simpleAnswer: "High-risk people want insurance more - People who know they're likely to have claims seek insurance more aggressively than low-risk people, creating an imbalance.",

                question: "Which of these statements about an insurance policy is TRUE?",
                answers: ["The insured can stop paying premiums anytime, but the insurer must continue coverage", "Both parties can cancel anytime for any reason", "The insured must pay all premiums first, then file claims", "Only the insured makes legally binding promises"],
                correct: 0,
                explanation: "This describes a 'Unilateral Contract.' Only the insurance company makes a legally enforceable promise: 'If you have a covered loss, we WILL pay.' You don't promise to pay premiums! You can stop paying anytime and they'll just cancel your policy. They can't sue you for future premiums. Compare to a lease where both you AND the landlord make promises - both parties are locked in.",
                simpleAnswer: "Only the insurance company makes binding promises - You can stop paying and cancel anytime, but if you have a covered loss, they MUST pay as promised.",

                answers: ["A dangerous situation", "The specific cause of a loss (like fire, wind, theft)", "A pearl necklace coverage", "The chance of loss"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "A Peril is simply the CAUSE of a loss - the specific event or thing that damaged your property. Common perils: fire, lightning, windstorm, hail, explosion, theft, vandalism. Insurance policies either list specific covered perils ('Named Peril') or cover all perils except excluded ones ('Open Peril'). Whenever you see 'peril,' just think 'cause of damage' or 'type of claim.'",
                simpleAnswer: "Peril = Type of damage/cause of loss - Just a fancy word for what caused the damage (fire, theft, wind, etc.). Each policy lists which perils it covers.",

                question: "What is the difference between 'Replacement Cost' and 'Agreed Value'?",
                answers: ["They are the same thing", "Replacement Cost pays to rebuild; Agreed Value is a pre-set amount both parties agreed to", "Agreed Value is always less than Replacement Cost", "Replacement Cost includes depreciation"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "REPLACEMENT COST: The insurance company calculates what it costs to rebuild/replace at the time of the loss. If lumber prices doubled, they pay the current higher price. AGREED VALUE: You and the company agree upfront on a specific value (like $500,000) and that's what they'll pay regardless of actual costs. Used for antique cars, artwork, or unique historic buildings. Replacement Cost adjusts with the market. Agreed Value is locked in.",
                simpleAnswer: "Replacement Cost adjusts with market; Agreed Value is locked in - RC pays whatever it costs now to rebuild, AV pays a pre-set dollar amount you both agreed to at policy start.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "An Endorsement (also called 'Rider' or 'Floater') is a document that modifies your policy - adds coverage, removes coverage, or changes terms. Common endorsements: Scheduled Personal Property (jewelry coverage), Earthquake Coverage, Water Backup Coverage, Increased Limits, Named Driver Exclusion. When an endorsement conflicts with the main policy, the endorsement wins. They usually cost extra if adding coverage, or give discount if removing.",
                simpleAnswer: "A policy change form - A written attachment that adds, removes, or modifies coverage on your policy (like adding earthquake coverage or increasing limits).",

                question: "What is the difference between a 'Claim' and a 'Loss'?",
                answers: ["They mean the same thing", "A loss is the event that causes damage; a claim is your request for payment", "A claim is bigger than a loss", "You report losses but not claims"],
                correct: 1,
                explanation: "LOSS = The actual event that caused damage (fire burns house, thief steals TV, storm damages roof). CLAIM = Your formal request to the insurance company to pay for the loss. Example: Lightning strikes house Friday (LOSS). Monday you call insurance asking them to pay for repairs (CLAIM). Not all losses result in claims - if damage is less than deductible, you might not file a claim.",
                simpleAnswer: "Loss is the damage event, claim is the payment request - The loss is what happened to your property; the claim is when you ask insurance to pay for it.",

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Depreciation is how much value something loses as it gets older and used. A 5-year-old car is worth less than a new car. A 10-year-old roof is worth less than a new roof. Insurance uses this to calculate ACV (Actual Cash Value). Example: New couch costs $1,000. After 5 years, it's depreciated 40%. Now it's worth $600 (60% of original). With ACV coverage, you'd get $600. With Replacement Cost coverage, you'd get $1,000.",
                simpleAnswer: "Loss of value over time - How much something is worth after being used, considering age and wear. Used to calculate Actual Cash Value payments.",

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "'Per Occurrence' means the limit applies to each separate accident, no matter how many people are hurt. Example: $300,000 Per Occurrence. One accident injures 5 people totaling $400,000. Insurance pays $300,000 max (you owe $100,000). All 5 people share the $300,000. If you cause TWO separate accidents, each gets its own $300,000 limit. 'Per Occurrence' is different from 'Aggregate' which is your total limit for the whole policy period.",
                simpleAnswer: "Limit applies to each separate accident - Each incident gets the full limit, no matter how many people are hurt in that one incident.",

                answers: ["Yes, it's good marketing", "Yes, but only with supervisor approval", "No, this is called rebating and is illegal", "Yes, but only if the customer asks first"],
                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Rebating is strictly illegal in NC and most states. If agents could offer cash or gifts, it would become a bidding war. Agents would compete by offering bigger bribes instead of better service or coverage. Insurance agents must compete based on service and knowledge, not bribes. Violation can result in license suspension or revocation.",
                simpleAnswer: "No - Rebating (offering cash or special deals not listed in the policy) is illegal because it's like bribing someone to buy insurance.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "NC has a unique system. The state says companies MUST offer insurance to all eligible drivers AND limits how much they can charge. The NC Reinsurance Facility is the solution. When a company must insure a high-risk driver, they can 'cede' (transfer) that risk to the Facility. All insurance companies in NC share the losses from these high-risk drivers. It's like the whole state chips in to make sure even high-risk people can get insurance.",

                explanation: "Excess and Surplus Lines (often just called 'E&S' or 'surplus lines') refers to insurance placed with non-admitted insurance carriers for risks that cannot be placed in the standard admitted market. These are typically unique, high-risk, or unusual exposures.

                explanation: "NC allows arbitration clauses in insurance policies BUT they must be clearly disclosed and specifically agreed to by the insured. The insured must knowingly waive their right to jury trial. Arbitration clauses cannot be hidden in fine print. For Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist coverage specifically, NC law requires an arbitration provision, but the insured can reject it in writing. Arbitration can be faster and cheaper than lawsuits but limits your legal options.",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "NC has a Valued Policy Law that applies specifically to TOTAL LOSSES by FIRE. If a building is completely destroyed by fire, the insurance company must pay the full policy limit (face amount) stated in the policy, regardless of the actual value. This prevents disputes over value after a total fire loss. However, this ONLY applies to: (1) Total losses, not partial, (2) Fire losses specifically, (3) Buildings, not contents.

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "TRICK QUESTION! NC does NOT use Pure Comparative Negligence. NC uses 'CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE' - one of only a few states that does. Under contributory negligence, if you are even 1% at fault for an accident, you cannot recover ANY damages from the other party. This is very harsh for plaintiffs. Example: You're 5% at fault, other driver is 95% at fault. In NC, you get ZERO. Most states use comparative negligence where your recovery is just reduced by your fault percentage.",

Animals are considered unpredictable moving objects, like an 'act of nature.' You can't control when a deer jumps in front of you.",
